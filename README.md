# Vue admin panel for a Flower shop

I am building this project because almost 5 years ago I built a web admin system for a flowershop with just Laravel. This time I want to build it using Vue and Laravel with GraphQl.
I enjoy it building this becasue I can improve my programming skills. Most of the Projects I have been working on does not exist anymore so I think this is a good way to show other people the way I develop.

I will be doing a Roadmap on [Notion](https://neftaliaguilar.notion.site/neftaliaguilar/ba41c82bbd6648c89e7385ad9377b782?v=ebc29a1ce3034fdf86575e20b0b540bf) so you can view how big can the project be.
